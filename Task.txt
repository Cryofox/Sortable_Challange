The Challenge
The goal is to use text similarity to match product listings from a 3rd party retailer, e.g. “Nikon D90 12.3MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)” against a set of known products, e.g. “Nikon D90″.
We’ll provide you with a set of products and a set of price listings matching some of those products. The task is to match each listing to the correct product. Precision is critical. We much prefer missed matches (lower recall) over incorrect matches, so try hard to avoid false positives. A single price listing may match at most one product.
Be careful not to tie your logic too tightly to the input data. We will run your solution against both the listings provided in the challenge, and a different set of listings that you don’t get to see ahead of time. No giant if statements tailored exactly to the test data, please!
